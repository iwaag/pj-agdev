# Workflow editor file contract (p1, p2/pre1)

The definition files are the authority. The editor reads and writes them; it
keeps no database. A person or an agent can edit the same files with any text
editor, and the editor reflects those edits.

**Writers take turns.** The p1 editor assumes that UI edits and external file
edits do not overlap. It has no revision checks, merging or conflict
resolution. Its external-change guard (below) only keeps an unsaved UI draft
from being silently replaced.

## Where things live

| Information | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Project schema, stable ID, name, intent, goals | `project.yaml` at the project root |
| Submodule paths and source locations | `.gitmodules` at the project root |
| Recorded submodule revisions | Gitlinks in the root repository |
| Checkout, initialization, uncommitted changes | The workspace's Git state |
| Workflow definition, approvals, layout | `devdocs/workflows/*.yaml` |
| Registered workspaces and host settings | An ignored local registry (`registry.json`) |

A project is a Git repository, conventionally `pj-<name>`. `devdocs/` is a
required submodule. Other submodules may live under `study/`, `wedo/` or any
other path; those names categorize repositories and imply nothing about node
types or access. Every workspace has an ignored `.local/` directory.

`project.yaml` stays small. It does not copy repository URLs, branches,
commits or workspace lists. Workflows are discovered from
`devdocs/workflows/*.yaml` (and `*.yml`); a workflow is identified by its `id`,
not its file name.

## `ag.project.v1`

```yaml
schema: ag.project.v1
id: demo                 # stable; see "Identifiers"
name: Demo Delivery Project
intent: |
  Why the project exists.
goals:
  - One goal per item.
```

## `ag.workflow.v1`

```yaml
schema: ag.workflow.v1
id: onboarding           # stable; delegates refer to it
name: Service Onboarding # display only
intent: |
  The author's intent. Everything else is reviewed against it.
repositories:            # binding key -> project-relative path and access
  tools: {path: study/tools, access: readonly}
  runtime: {path: wedo/runtime, access: editable}
  docs: {path: devdocs, access: editable}
  root: {path: ., access: readonly}
nodes:                   # node id -> node
  survey:
    type: study          # study | do | delegate | talk
    name: Survey         # short card label, optional
    description: What this step does.
    repositories: [tools]
  setup:
    type: delegate
    description: Run repository setup and wait for it.
    workflow: repo-setup # target workflow id (delegate only)
edges:
  - {from: survey, to: setup}
approvals:               # written by the editor's approval actions
  intent: {digest: "sha256:…", approver: someone, at: "2026-10-10T12:00:00.000Z"}
  definition: {digest: "sha256:…", approver: someone, at: "2026-10-10T12:00:00.000Z"}
layout:                  # optional; absent positions are laid out automatically
  nodes:
    survey: {x: 40, y: 60}
```

### Identifiers

Workflow IDs, node IDs and binding keys match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_.-]{0,63}$`.
IDs are stable: names and descriptions change without changing IDs. A delegate
resolves its target by workflow ID within the same project, independent of the
target's name or file name.

### Repository bindings

`path` is project-relative POSIX: `.` is the project root, `devdocs` the devdocs
submodule, anything else must be a submodule path in `.gitmodules`. Absolute
paths and `..` are invalid. A binding to a path that is not in `.gitmodules`
is reported as missing; a submodule that is not initialized in the current
workspace is reported as such (a warning — it depends on the workspace, not
the definition).

`access` is `readonly` or `editable`. In p1 it is a declaration and a
restriction on the editor's own operations, not filesystem isolation: external
editors and agents can still change a readonly repository. Access belongs to
the workflow: the same repository can be readonly in one workflow and editable
in another.

### Node types and repository conventions

| Type | What the step is |
| --- | --- |
| `study` | Research: reading the web or files a person points to, and recording what was learned |
| `do` | General work: coding, running and testing, file operations |
| `talk` | Consulting a person, or an agent they entrusted, to agree on something or get permission |
| `delegate` | Running another workflow of the project (`workflow: <id>`) |

Submodules under `study/` conventionally accumulate the results of study
steps (repository names prefixed `study-`). Submodules under `wedo/`
accumulate what was learned while doing the work (prefixed `wedo-`).
Other paths are free. These are conventions for sharing knowledge between
workflows. They imply nothing about access, which each workflow declares in
its bindings. A node may bind no repository, and a binding that no node uses
is allowed.

### Graph semantics

An edge means that its target waits for its source to complete. Several
outgoing edges are parallel branches; a node with several incoming edges waits
for all of them. A delegate waits for its target workflow to complete; work
beside a delegate is another branch. Graphs must be acyclic. Runs (p3/pre1)
record execution against a fixed copy of a definition and check these rules
when nodes start and complete; nothing schedules or performs nodes. See
[runs.md](runs.md).

## Validation

Validation checks structure and references. It never claims that a graph
fulfils its intent.

| Code | Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | error | `schema` is not `ag.workflow.v1` |
| `id-missing`, `id-invalid`, `id-duplicate` | error | workflow ID absent, malformed, or used by another file |
| `intent-missing` | error | empty intent |
| `name-missing` | warning | empty display name |
| `binding-id-invalid`, `binding-access`, `binding-path-invalid` | error | malformed binding |
| `repository-missing` | error | binding path is not the root or a `.gitmodules` path |
| `repository-uninitialized` | warning | submodule exists but is not checked out here |
| `node-id-invalid`, `node-type` | error | malformed node |
| `node-binding-missing` | error | node refers to an undeclared binding key |
| `node-description-missing`, `node-binding-duplicate`, `nodes-empty` | warning | incomplete draft |
| `delegate-target-missing`, `delegate-target-unknown`, `delegate-self`, `delegate-recursive` | error | delegate target absent, not in the project, itself, or reaching back to itself |
| `workflow-on-non-delegate` | warning | `workflow` on a non-delegate node |
| `edge-from-missing`, `edge-to-missing`, `edge-self`, `graph-cycle` | error | broken or cyclic edges |
| `edge-duplicate`, `layout-orphan` | warning | redundant entries |

Drafts with errors can be saved. They cannot be approved.

## Supported YAML subset

One YAML 1.2 document per file, using block or flow mappings and sequences,
plain/quoted/block scalars, and comments. Mapping keys are plain text.

Rejected without rewriting the file: anchors (`&a`), aliases (`*a`), explicit
tags (`!!str`), merge keys (`<<`), several documents in one file, non-text
keys, and duplicate keys. Fields with the wrong shape (for example `nodes` as a
sequence) are also rejected. A rejected file is shown with its error and
cannot be saved from the editor until it is fixed by hand.

### What an edit preserves

The editor applies a model onto the parsed document instead of regenerating
the file:

- Fields the model does not know (top-level, per node, per binding) are kept.
- Comments, key order, flow/block style and block scalars of untouched
  entries are kept. An unchanged document is written back byte for byte.
- New entries take the style of the file's conventions: multiline text as
  `|` blocks; bindings, edges and layout points in flow style.
- Known normalizations by the YAML library: the spacing before a trailing
  comment becomes one space; flow collections are written without inner
  padding (`[a, b]`).
- A key absent from the file and empty in the model stays absent.

## Approvals and canonicalization

Two independent approval records, each storing the approved digest, the
declared approver and the time:

1. **Intent approval** covers `intent`.
2. **Definition approval** covers intent, repository bindings (key, path,
   access), node IDs, types, names, descriptions, node repository bindings,
   delegate targets, and edges.

Excluded from both digests: workflow `id` and `name`, approvals, layout,
fields outside the contract, comments, key order and YAML formatting.

Digest = `sha256:` + hex SHA-256 of the UTF-8 canonical JSON of a projection:

- Intent: `{"intent": T(intent), "kind": "ag.workflow.v1/intent"}`.
- Definition: `{"edges": [[from, to], …], "intent": T(intent), "kind":
  "ag.workflow.v1/definition", "nodes": {id: {"description": T, "name": T,
  "repositories": [sorted, unique], "type": …, "workflow": id or null}},
  "repositories": {key: {"access": …, "path": normalized path}}}`; edges are
  de-duplicated and sorted by `from`, then `to`.
- Canonical JSON: keys sorted by UTF-16 code unit, no insignificant
  whitespace, standard JSON string escaping.
- `T(text)`: CRLF/CR become LF, trailing spaces/tabs on each line are removed,
  leading and trailing blank lines are removed. So `|` versus `|-` or an
  editor stripping trailing spaces does not change a digest.
- Paths are normalized (`./devdocs/` → `devdocs`).

A record is **approved** when its digest equals the current content's digest,
**stale** when it differs (the record is kept, not erased), and the kind is
**unapproved** when there is no record. Changing intent makes both stale; a
node description or edge change makes definition stale; a layout change makes
neither stale.

Approvals are about the definition. They are not permission to execute,
acceptance of results, or an attestation of repository contents, and they do
not authenticate anyone: the approver is declared and the YAML can be edited
directly. Approval actions work on saved content without errors.

## Saving and external changes

- The filesystem is authoritative. The UI holds a draft until an explicit Save.
- Save writes the definition file only. It never commits or pushes.
- Saves write a temporary file in the same directory and rename it over the
  target, so a reader never sees a half-written file. This protects file
  integrity, not against a simultaneous external writer.
- While a browser view is open, the service watches the workspace and tells
  the UI what changed. It polls the definition files every second; a file is
  re-read only when its size, modification time or inode changed. It checks
  Git state every three seconds: HEAD, the index, uncommitted files in the
  root and in submodules, and submodule checkouts. Nothing is watched while no
  view is open. Each view also has a Refresh action that re-reads at once.
- Without unsaved UI changes the UI reloads automatically. With unsaved
  changes it keeps the draft, shows that the file changed, and offers an
  explicit reload that discards the draft.
- After the connection to the service drops, the view says that it is not
  live. When it reconnects, it re-reads everything, so edits made in between
  are shown.
- A deleted or renamed open workflow is shown read-only with that fact, and
  with a link when another file has the same workflow id. Nothing is
  recreated, and saving is refused.
- If the file on disk is malformed or unsupported, the UI keeps the last valid
  rendering read-only with the parse error, and the service refuses to save
  over the invalid file. Correcting the file restores editing.
- A failed save stays visible and the draft is kept for retry.
