"""What each observed run needs, decided from workflow and executor facts.

observer p3 step 3 (`docs/workflow.md`, *Classification*). Pure: an
observation (`ag.wfe-observation.v1`, `wfe observe`) in, findings out. No
Zulip, no Front, no topic names, no serving ids — a run is its `uid`, and
everything said about it comes from its record, its attempts, its process
and its queue as WFE reports them.

A finding is a *suspicion* with an identity: `(uid, family, episode)`. The
monitor turns it into an incident when its grace has passed; the identity
is what keeps a re-description of the same episode from opening a second
incident or replenishing a budget.
